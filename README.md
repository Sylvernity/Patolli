# What is Patolli?
[Patolli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patolli) is an ancient board game created in Mesoamerican cultures akin to modern-day [Sorry!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)).

# The Program
This program is designed to have two players, L and N. Player L's pieces are marked by letters (A-F), and Player N's pieces are marked by numbers (1-6). The board is printed out in a vertical cross. Spaces are numbered starting at 1 at the top right space of the board and moving clockwise around the edge. Players alternate turns and are prompted for input one by one. A dice is automatically rolled each turn to determine movement.
